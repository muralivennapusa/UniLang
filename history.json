        "Response": "Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that whenever one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts a force of equal magnitude and in the opposite direction back on the first object. This principle highlights the mutual interactions between objects and is fundamental to understanding motion and forces in physics."

        "message": "define inertia",
        "Response": "Inertia is a property of matter that describes an object's resistance to changes in its state of motion. Specifically, it refers to the tendency of an object to remain at rest or to continue moving in a straight line at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. This concept is a fundamental principle in physics, particularly in Newton's first law of motion, which states that an object will not change its motion unless a net force acts on it. Inertia is directly related to the mass of an object; more massive objects have greater inertia and require more force to change their motion."

        "Response": "Light exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties, a phenomenon known as wave-particle duality. In some experiments, light behaves like a wave, demonstrating characteristics such as interference and diffraction. In other contexts, it behaves like a particle, as seen in the photoelectric effect, where light can be thought of as being made up of discrete packets of energy called photons. This dual nature is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, illustrating that light does not fit neatly into the classical categories of \"wave\" or \"particle.\""

        "Response": "The lore of the \"Tekken\" series revolves around the Mishima family and their tumultuous relationships, alongside various other characters who participate in the King of Iron Fist Tournament. \n\nAt the center of the story is the Mishima Zaibatsu, a powerful corporation led by Heihachi Mishima. Heihachi's son, Kazuya Mishima, seeks revenge against his father for throwing him into a ravine as a child. This act ignites a bitter rivalry that spans generations. Kazuya becomes possessed by the Devil Gene, granting him immense power but also driving him to darkness.\n\nThe series also features other characters with their own backstories, such as Jin Kazama, Kazuya's son, who struggles with the Devil Gene and seeks to end the Mishima family's cycle of violence. Other fighters, such as Nina Williams, Paul Phoenix, and Marshall Law, have their own motivations for entering the tournaments, often intersecting with the Mishima saga.\n\nOverall, \"Tekken\" explores themes of revenge, family, power, and the consequences of ambition, all set against the backdrop of intense martial arts competition."
